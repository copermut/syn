[[Verticals]], (short for 'vertical markets'), are a niche market matched in symmetry to a group's specialised needs. The vertical axis implies the market's potential to expand ('vertically'), if engaged with [_to my understanding_].
- The niche can be the group receiving the service, but others in the domain are also within the _vertical market_ (interacting with and potentially entering the niche as it expands/deepens into the vertical, i.e. impels other entities in the _context_ around those prevailing in the niche)
  - _"a niche is very defined, whilst a vertical is a movement up or down from the niche"_ ([via][wfvertical])
- In this lingo, a horizontal market indicates a broad market [i.e. non-niche], who a niche terminology can incidentally also serve.

## Definitions

1. _A market which meets the needs of a particular industry: for example, a piece of equipment used only by semiconductor manufacturers. opposite of horizontal market._ ([via](http://www.investorwords.com/5242/vertical_market.html))

  - This illustrates the concept's implication of expansion: semiconductors are a highly specialised market, yet their growth comes from success in that niche deepening through enrichment of neighbouring connections (dormant/latent agents). <sup>`TODO:verify`</sup>

  > `Dr Toktam` "I think maybe the mistake that we as technologists did previously is to design something, for a given crowd, and then take it to them and say 'now use it'. Why? What we're trying to do now is to codesign the system, together, to understand their needs, to understand their [[language|verticals: language notes]], and to understand what they expect from a system. So, we have a design which satisfies their expectation, and is something which solves existing problems - it doesn't solve the [[imaginative|imaginative verticals]] problems.

  - To me this has strong links to the discussion of domain understanding (not necessarily supervised learning) at Cafe Sci on Text Mining with Sophia Ananiadou (28th July 2016), _[[Finding the needle in the haystack you didn't even know was there]]_.
