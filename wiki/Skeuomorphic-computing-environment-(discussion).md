- Skeuomorphism is the least compelling *morphism (virtually decorative) and also what's used in all computing systems: making buggy mimics of 1980s offices - goes some way to explaining the dire state of software (programs from bottom up, files, folders, programs, REST, TCP, HTTP) consequentially the social arrangement of computing, visible in how it's less rigorous than engineering sciences
  - essentially a lot of the tools computer types work with now are built on faulty, flawed metaphors and principles that are holding the field back
  - Right now the field is essentially a Mexican standoff between the desktop metaphor, telephone lines, The War Machine, and mathematicians
  - even 'fascicle level' work, there are 'people whose whole lives are computers', whimsy from people who don't know what they're talking about
  - __to build a robust discipline CS would need to throw away the cruft it's built up, think less in terms of bit-banging, file manipulation, and imperative [or worse, type-agnostic] programming and move towards [discipline/culture] focusing on handling and manipulating information__
    - transactions too: relational data is beautiful in concept, despite SQL
- Prevailing vision remains of computing as some logical extension of telecommunications, as means of prediction and enactment of military activity, and of computing as a sub-branch of mathematics despite few to no unifying principles between them
- IoT and 'smart dust'* level earth-moving periods will inevitably move computing away from these paradigms but for the time being we're stuck totally outmoded. There are no people thinking about computing/information who aren't thoroughly haunted/parasitised by the relics of Bell and unix
- [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) is fine and even in the event it wasn't it's compulsory... and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)... but pretty much everything else...

#### * smart dust is apparently not actually being discussed at conferences [asked B Adryan who attends industry events].

  - A: true, but these things are asymptotic, computing things trend towards ubiquity
