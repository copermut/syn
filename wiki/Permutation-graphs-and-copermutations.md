A wiki demonstrates a graph of connected concepts (though not a 'knowledge graph' in the strict sense of [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))). <sup>`TODO:verify`</sup>

A [permutation graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_graph) can be applied to a network of concepts, but what's subsequently viewed are not nodes from the original concept map, nor edges of the graph of alterations made by a reordering (the 2 intuitive features of regular graphs), but rather: the edges that cross on a matching diagram of the permutation against that structure which is permuted. Understanding this, I interpret them for a knowledge graph as '_attentional verticals_'.

[This analogy is likely unclear as I'll clarify in revision, and through graphical depiction] <sup>`TODO:clarify`</sup>

The analogy goes like:
- in business terminology, 'vertical' is shorthand for 'vertical market' and has 2 implications:
  1. a population of interest (i.e. multiplicity, or a domain)
  2. specificity (i.e. direction of attention, or a restricted range)
- ...<sup>`TODO:clarify`</sup>
- ...when applied to a knowledge graph its meaning suggests a 'bottom up' approach to search space, by which items (nodes i.e. concepts etc) which are targetted as 'of interest' (i.e. given attention) act similarly to keywords.
  - This concept of items 'expressing a search space' is intuitive from recommendation systems, explained well in this video: <sup>`TODO:get video` (Omnity vimeo, tweeted)</sup>
  - see: [[Attentional verticals]]
- the connections of a permutation graph [applied over a knowledge graph, a.k.a. _ontology_] constitute _modifications_ of a _patterning_ applied to concepts (crossings on the matching diagram).
  - the 'modification' is nuanced: <sup>`TODO:clarify`</sup>
  - this metaphor gets deep and tricky, but thankfully there is already an extensive literature using "neural network" as a biological metaphor at the intersection of information theory and neuroscience by which to make it more intuitive and thus more effective as a narrative device (for both personal use and exposition).
- Crossings on the matching diagram / edges of the permutation graph ∴ have a subtle meaning, which I'm hoping to elucidate, but my initial induction* is that there is an indication within this alteration of concept-structure of a shift in _attention_ of some overarching process, such as one that may be being deliberately carried out within an inference process (e.g. [Hebbian](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Artificial_Neural_Networks/Hebbian_Learning) [ANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) procedures, reweighting etc.). <sup>`TODO:clarify`</sup>
  - see: Wiki - [Hebbian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) / Hebb's rule
  - NB: pattern analysis is more often unsupervised cf. classification more oft supervised.

A _copermutation_ has a distinct meaning in French <sup>†</sup>, a theological concept which the likes of Pascal would surely have been aware of as he intermingled his _Pensées_ later into a work entitled _An Apology for the Christian Religion_ - the century following [the Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), during which [benefices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice) (rewards for the clergy) were removed

- Pascal's writings on combinations, permutations as projective geometry/combinatorics problems applied to probability are thus not entirely inseparable from the intriguingly similarly named concept of 'copermutations' (relating to the aforementioned [benefices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice), a legal entity relating to land ownership - or more strictly [usufruct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usufruct)).

Pascal's fragmentary approach to writing (_liasses_, in modern French translated as 'bundle', 'batch', 'wad', 'unit-set', or 'sheaf') permitted and encouraged right up to the point of publication the free association of concepts such that the attention of the editor (_i.e._, the publisher) would rearrange sections and in turn their internal structure.

This approach has a deep and beautiful significance for his work, and in an age of computational shortcuts truly emphasises the restrictions imposed by filing systems' physical considerations (as regards memory, linearity, edition/versioning, and by contrast the objectifying effect of rigid textual structures).

- to develop: '[[Attentional verticals]]'
  - by analogy, converse (?) : [[Differential privacy]] (or rather, continuing with the attentional analogy what is the meaning of differential privacy on a knowledge graph permutation graph - private attention? "Inner thought" of an ANN ? (!)

  - NB: first, note Pascal rejected mind/body dualism <sup>`TODO:source`</sup> and regarded man as 'automaton' (one could also say 'machinic') in a way that here is to be interpreted w.r.t. information theory [cf. theology]. He took from [biblical reading] [Ecclesiastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes), 'man is wretched because of his awareness through reason'. To me, this gives the term 'ecclesiastical' an information theoretical sense, and as such allows interpretation of 'copermutations' through further analogy. <sup>`TODO:TBC`</sup>
