Discussion of "grounding", and "[earthing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system)" appear somewhat analagous to "ground-truth", for flows of information cf. electrical.

> circuitry which connects parts of the electric circuit with the ground, thus defining the electric potential of the conductors relative to the Earth's conductive surface. The choice of earthing system can affect the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the power supply. In particular, it affects the magnitude and distribution of short circuit currents through the system, and the effects it creates on equipment and people in the proximity of the circuit. If a fault within an electrical device connects a live supply conductor to an exposed conductive surface, anyone touching it while electrically connected to the earth will complete a circuit back to the earthed supply conductor and receive an electric shock.

At base, such systems are the only buffer against transience[[ﾌ]]interception

  > Back in 2012, [we announced](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/08/speech-recognition-and-deep-learning.html) that Google voice search had taken a new turn by adopting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as the core technology used to model the sounds of a language. These replaced the 30-year old standard in the industry: the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). DNNs were better able to assess which sound a user is producing at every instant in time, and with this they delivered greatly increased speech recognition accuracy.

## Note on spin systems

Twitter feels claustrophobic lately, like I need space to develop thoughts/lens other than "educational" projections

- spin systems have a ground state
- a space in which to permute without being transfixed would be most productive
