I like the idea of a URL-adjourned "virtual journal club" and haven't heard it suggested in discussions of open access _etc._

- those I've seen e.g. [this one](https://twitter.com/seandavis12/status/753561779226210304) in biological research this summer seem needlessly restrictive.  
There's no reason to limit discussion/engagement on the web to a single arbitrary point in time (e.g. if I were to post a paper this week many will be on their holidays)
  - therefore paper should be accessible to the journal club not just via short term email/paper handouts
    - my blog posts from years ago are widely accessed by researchers at research institutions, seeking 'peers' in the literal sense of the word, and importantly in a convenient manner
    - PDFs are long recognised out of touch (there was a [conference](https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/) about moving past their A4-paper-mimicking inefficiency 5 years ago and nothing has changed)
    - Moreover, network/device memory issues will continually hold back researchers leaving us tutting at loading screens and students without large cloud storage accounts unable to download many to their phones in addition to the pictures, apps etc.
    - this becomes apparent when travelling, as researchers often do for conferences etc.

#### Result 1

Rather than finding solutions to the problems we are employed to be, we waste time accessing the research we want to read.

#### Result 2

Rather than reading the research we want to, we give up on the benefits of network effects, extended trains of thought and brainwaves that turn up on trains, planes and automobiles. Instead we read the usual, only when at a computer, and the pace of research is checked.

- Trains of thought are not just broken off in their prime, but lost.

- Journals are not leading the way when it comes to accomodating mobile users, to say the least
  - convenience of reading for researchers in transit is not valued.

- Awkward fixes to set up email arrangements / garner emails via Twitter (like the "#icanhazpdf" effort) are not the solution.

- Whatever one's opinion on SciHub, it has been effectively criminalised and made inaccessible via some university campus networks (such as mine) so I don't view that as viable/sustainable.

- A more permissive "virtual journal club" format would be open, and fair use as long as it was the primary source of entry to the provided paper, for researchers' convenience, providing a service that journals should be but are not.

- 'Primary point of entry' as in, _attention to the research domain led to joining the 'journal club' in whatever form_ rather than looking for the paper led to this alternative route (thereby arguably from the publisher's view overstepping fair use by individual[s]).

- Without this, great initiatives like [ShortScience](http://www.shortscience.org/about) can't be applied to biology. Preprints are growing but the majority of our research is inconvenient to access
