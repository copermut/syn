There are multiple uses of the word 'copermutation' in the modern day mathematical literature.

Just 3 instances can be found on Google Scholar: for the time being I've only looked into the first of these meanings, by Saul Stahl.

  1. I don't find its discussion of copermutation matrices particularly enlightening <sup>`TODO:reread`</sup>
  2. ...but it is dedicated to [Leon Mirsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Mirsky), whose theorem on partially ordered sets is very beautiful - see: [[Minsky and Dilworth's theorems]] and Wiki: [Minsky's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirsky%27s_theorem)

>  for permutation graphs: a graph GA is a permutation graph iff both GA and co GA are comparability graphs iff GA   is an intersection graph of linear segments between two vertical parallel segments L1, L2. We define a filament as the union of linear segments in a family _ff_ fulfilling that ⋃<sub>_c∈ff_ </sub>c is continuous. As above, we can define 3D-interval-filament graphs for permutation graphs, called 3D-permutation filament graphs (copermutation graphs are permutation graphs [6]) and the equivalent permutation overlap graphs.
