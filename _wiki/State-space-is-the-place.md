__NB__ - this does not seem to belong here, but as something very specifically technical related to {{spin.systems :: {{PROPOSAL:TBC}} }} (more its chemical than optic aspect)
- really don't know what to recommend... the metaphor is too porous to split off but it is literally discussing chemical bonding/electron configuration laws... but all info theory at the end of the day and this is an interdisciplinary effort.
  - __Note to reader__: with apologies to the reader if they don't like chemistry/physics

Resolved: new project at [spin.systems](http://spin.systems), an outlet for specifically physical science-related readings, chains of reasoning, & trains of thought

- [optogenetics](https://github.com/spin-systems/optogenetics-reads)
- [statistics](https://github.com/spin-systems/statistical-reads)
- [computer vision](https://github.com/spin-systems/vision-reads) (CV)
- [optics](https://github.com/spin-systems/optics)
- [general flow; dynamical systems, autotelic](https://github.com/spin-systems/flow)
- retained one less structured outlet, [exopore](https://github.com/lmmx/exopore)
