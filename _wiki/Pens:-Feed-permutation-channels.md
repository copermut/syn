- If an RSS feed 'consumes' a post before it is finished (in draft) then it can be fed something, then the original deleted
- This represents a storage medium
  - This represents a channel
- If an RSS feed can be fed to represent a state in time this represents a temporal channel
  - If the same item can be represented in different feeds it can be a channel of multiple states in time
  - i.e. a feed can be read at multiple points in time, passed to 'mirror' feeds which end up differing slightly
- If multiple RSS feeds 'consume' a post it is stored.. in permutations?
---
- Essentially RSS readers are a big data maw that don't check for reversioning/edition - not sure about deletion

## Extension

- Perhaps, could be used for a form of computation wherein change of state does not impart any information — i.e., the feed is not being monitored for revision — but [think: extremely simple signalling model] only the switch between __order__ of items is indicative

  - NB tweet sent a while after being typed out 
  - just hit send, though written just after the idea arose
    - tweet time difference ~2hrs
      - 1:32pm to 3:45pm maximum difference: may have seen original tweet a short while after being sent...
      - perhaps more like 1hr, 1hr30m diff?

- (...vague sense that above calculation is relevant to that which it discusses)

- __NB__: more hypothetical/theoretical than the identitarian focus of the tweet being responded to
  - more signal processing / information theoretical notion but obviously application domain is open
