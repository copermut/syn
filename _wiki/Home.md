Welcome to the copermut wiki!

This Wiki is under construction as I flesh out some ideas on mathematics, information theory, and assistive technologies for scientific research in the fields of computer vision, image processing and NLP. To avoid creating a maze of complexity, where appropriate, lines of enquiry are constructed through presentation of a background at the start of articles that lead on from prior readings or development.

Web project forthcoming at [_permut.co_](http://permut.co)
