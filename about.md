# copermut

[permut.co](http://permut.co) – Web project on information theory, graph patterns, permutations, and recombinations

> `(478)(356) ⪯ `:computer:

### Aims:
- self-hosted: first project on own server
- built with Structr and parallel Neo4j
- design and form graph database of concepts (named entities as well as Wiki-structured map)

### Long term goals:
- management of abstract/deep connections inferred through a hypergraph database on top of Neo4j
  - study own and/or user learning/attention processes ('explanatory' modelling)
  - machine learning models (TensorFlow)
- offline RDF analysis: concept graph enrichment/structuring

### Research-assistive application:
- Biological research-oriented spin-off with the same format, use of biological linked data ("[ontologies](http://obofoundry.org)")

- see: [Wiki](https://github.com/lmmx/copermut/wiki) consolidating readings and discussions of {category,graph,order} theory, {geometric,linear,matrix} algebra, {ML,DL,NLP} — _etc._ — as imaginative routes and progressive community resource in systems biology, genomic statistics, and their surrounding communities in the computer, life, and physical sciences.

# About the author

Louis Maddox, BSc Biochemistry 2015, MSc Bioinformatics and Systems Biology 2015-16

I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry in 2015 after an undergraduate stint at the University of Manchester, and a summer’s research placement with the Babu group at the MRC-LMB in Cambridge, which came about thanks to shared interests in intrinsically disordered proteins, the topic of my 2nd year dissertation, and various posts on my blog, [_biochemistri.es_](http://biochemistri.es).

During undergraduate study I fell down the rabbit hole of programming, and in my final year discovered the dynamical systems biology of ultradian [4-8 hour periodic] oscillations in gene expression. Cyclic gene regulation, I learnt, could be expressed through geometrical language, and had broad crossovers to physics and other fields. Within this I hunted out candidate miRNAs from microarray datasets, and stayed on to continue readings in this field for a Masters degree.

I’m currently working on research projects relating to cancer genetics within the University of Manchester Masters in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, and am seeking a PhD in mathematical/computational systems biology, as far as my abilities can take me really.

Towards this end, this site is an attempt to consolidate the broad readings (almost chaotically so at times) which encompass:

- __biochemical engineering__: beyond the fundamental biochemical and life sciences, systems/network approaches, and information theory [the 'informatics' in 'bioinformatics']) there are untapped areas of statistical physics, such as interfaces and colloids, which are forming a route to biophysics and nanoscience
- __engineering mathematics__
- __combinatorics__ I was mesmerised by _permutation_ through the writings of Greg Egan around the time of graduation, and later pulled by force into the application of permutation graphs in reading a biography of Pascal this year.
- __informatics__
- __machine learning and deep learning__ ("the only game in town") as an academic joked to me last month. GPUs and CUDA
  - __computer vision__
- __graphics__: GPUs once again: I'd currently like to learn more about _Vulkan API_, the successor to _OpenGL_
- __graphs__ (mathematical formulation, databases, category theory, algorithms on graphs)

An overarching theme is of 'usufructuary spaces' for research, and 'copermutation' (a long-winded, medieval French way of saying 'public good' as detailed in the notes herein). For obvious reasons this chimes with my goals as a scientist, but moreover I feel at this point that I need to actively construct a mode of knowledge work that will weave these complex threads into a more consistent picture.

Mentorship is greatly valued, so I'm putting these notes out here to maximise potential conversation as well as utility.

Find me on Twitter @biochemistries, as well as @permutans (my separate account for tech/programming-related goings on). @permutans is also where you can find me on the Telegram messaging service if you'd like to chat about the research discussed, request help, or propose a collaboration.
