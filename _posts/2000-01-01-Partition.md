Each p.f. Is constructed to represent a particular stat ensemble [in turn corresp to particular free energy]

- Most common stat ensembles have named p.f.s 
- Canonical partition func applies to a [canonical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_ensemble), in which the system can exchange heat with env at fixed T, v, and no. of particles 
    - Grand canonical partition function applies to a [grand canonical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_canonical_ensemble) in which system can exchange both heat and particles [at fixed T, v, chem potential] 
    - Protein ‘microstates’ of IDP are in [microcanonical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble) (NVE) - also [canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_ensemble) (NVT), [isoenthalpic-isobaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoenthalpic%E2%80%93isobaric_ensemble), [isothermal-isobaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal%E2%80%93isobaric_ensemble)
