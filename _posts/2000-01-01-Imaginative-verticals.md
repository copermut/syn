Background: [[Verticals]]

- To look into, in context of Dr Toktam Mahmoodi's [[technology design note|Verticals#technology-design-notes]], and extended computer vision metaphor <sup>`TODO:investigate`</sup>

## Case study: J G Ballard

Background: [[Concentration City (JG Ballard)]]

> "Chemistry & Industry … was a good place to work because, of course, the office of any scientific magazine is the most wonderful mail drop. It’s the ultimate information crossroads. Most of it went straight into the wastepaper basket, but en route I was filtering it like some sort of sea creature sailing with jaws open through a great sea of delicious plankton. I was filtering all this extraordinary material.”

— J. G. Ballard, on his post-war experiences in scientific writing ([via](http://www.ballardian.com/jg-ballards-experiment-in-chemical-living))

> "what happened at C&I codified the tropes Ballard was to return to throughout his career — the scientific, technical and imaginative motifs that shape the very essence of what we’ve come to know and love as ‘Ballardian’."

- Interpretation of Ballard's work: by analogy to the virtually decorative nature of skeuomorphic computing tropes...
  - see: [[Skeuomorphic computing environment (discussion)]]
- ...'imaginative verticals' thus suggests a means to 'reimagine' the negotiation of attention:
  - firstly, as a user [e.g. of a research assistive technology] your attention to each topic being researched.
    - "Imaginative" without being distracting (including being led astray or dwelling on unproductive subjects)
  - secondly, in the computer vision domain the visual attention to a parsed object:
    - would an extracted document feature then be explored? Would this constitute a compelling sense of the term 'imaginative vertical'?
    - possibly to algorithmically extracted features, or else features possibly highlighted through supervision of a user, VR etc., or possibly some augmented reality intermediate [hence the 'assistive' part]
