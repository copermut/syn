## Post-script

> "Who are we to turn each other's heads?"

Musing: IoT/M2M renders sensorium⇢porous outlet, early adoption highlights: experience ‘alone’ has rarefied thus far (personally, I can see positive/reason for hope/reasoned optimism in that)

- My only contributions to Google's map are:
  - a review of _The Real Camera Co._
  - a pocket upload
    - I would suggest the _Google Maps_ app's team would have hoped for such a blurring of intention and circumstance through their nigh-on belligerent notifications on the new feature to share visual experience publicly
    - the point of which: not for personal discoverability in the way legacy of social networks have structured themselves
      - points to deeper structuring of [_socius_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socius): tribalism, allyship, civil society, <strike>identification</strike>
        - __cursory note__: _Socius_ is also the name for genitalia of _Lepidoptera_, seemingly a topic to raise eyebrows but actually very important for theories of biogenesis (development, anatomy, natural history) and taxonomy
