- The flood algorithm operates on 1D automata
  - A sequence of images can be a 1D vector, the state space of processed-map (such as computer vision-detected textual content/information with all the semantics and further implications therein) being its arrow and ... [need to read _Nature of Code_ and get going with automata seriously!]
    - theory: image as automata, ...then not sure but think a great direction ?
