Opening "papers" is increasingly separated from a means to go back to source, and it's frustrating in both senses of the word :expressionless:

## Web readers

- __PDF.js__ 
  - as leveraged by ferret.ai research-assistive tools, plus access/tracking tools like Readcube etc
  - bookmarkable as the link, but difficult to click to pull out the original PDF URL

## Mobile readers

- Non-browser app defaults for the PDF mimetype (i.e. the file extension's default program setting) can mean you are shuttled from another app's external link (e.g. Twitter) to a PDF, which will open through an external PDF viewer which may have no available link sharing menu option ("copy link", "share")
  - forces user to leave the flow of their reading to open a laptop to get to the link (for services like citation/network exploration etc)
    - or else: wait til they can do - however, very likely to forget the train of thought about the research itself by the time they come to do so
  - Twitter in this example shortens all links to `t.co/`, so it's not possible for the user to retrieve it
  - personal experience with Chrome/Android - 2 most popular platforms, would assume similar on iOS

## Publishers

- Elsevier timeouts the link

- Wiley frames the PDF at a nice link, and embeds an ugly overcomplicated link as the iframe - deliberately breaking basic modes of accessing the document you are viewing (incl. Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts), e.g. Save, Find etc
  - totally harmful to researcher productivity -- causes breaks out of the researcher's flow of thought to battle against utterly superfluous DRM impositions
  - with this as the status quo, it begins to feel that the simple is asking the impossible. In a just world, we could expect this hugely profitable industry to give scientists greater assistance: making life easy in the form of:
    - mobile accessibility
      - text-to-speech for both convenience and accessibility/disability support,
      - facilitating off-campus access
        - perhaps through the existing technology of persistent browser cookies (but as far as I'm aware these are already used, I'm guessing they do more to enable user tracking than anything)
        - __Improvement:__ collaboration with services like Pocket [who told me via DM they struggled to communicate with them and were no longer pursuing the issue!]
      - working with developers to enable new modes of literature access (I don't really know the state of progress here as the area is too polarised/a bit too hectic for me, personally, to follow along with)
