- science in particular is in danger of becoming an internal activity in various senses from just inside the Academy to compartmentalised / inaccessible between regions of the Academy, to inaccessible to the minds of students at school who then have perhaps a less engaging/compelling/misaligned/adequately-directed vision of what each subject and specialisation might entail beyond the library books they seek out occasionally
- with consideration there are paths to release these authorial flows that can serve as both personal development channels and specific locus of attention (record, meaningful connection, though in current form all surface and 'link')
- annotation of a layer of connections like that with semantics of what has been seen and considered in the information is potentially much more useful
- ... services like pelican highlight the nature of a Blog as it exists is of an entity which is produced at a certain point in time despite the fact that we know understanding of scientific subjects is nonlinear ie cannot all be condensed down into consumable packet
- ... upon thinking about this, and wondering if perhaps we are wrong to think of a graph a social relation on which scientific research is shared rather than the manifold of ever blooming scientific works to be an assessor persistently, 'altogether', _au fur et Ã  mesure_
- ...lit. to the far and to measure ("to ... gradually"  i.e. progressively)
