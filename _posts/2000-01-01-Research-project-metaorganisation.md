- Background: [?]

Research project metaorganisation: in 8 parts, 2 of which are actually enclosing a senary inside,

- To set the senary,
  - _i.e._ a 6-partite organisational code, code in the sense of practical data structure open to consistent interpretation, as 'algorithm' is equivalent to 'data structure'
-â¤· as in IPython &c., a 'top level' for a project [enclosure, separation of concerns] and storage of project-specific materials
- Web pages that amass are grouped down forcibly from new windows into a single window: this will force the collapse of context, and with it crash tabs
  - Crashing the tabs highlights the overcomplex state space, which can then be readily pushed down into a plaintext format
  - Store all tabs equally, the only context differences being between up to 6 contexts [workspaces], each of which can receive a name [previous names can be reused/recommended perhaps; a set could even be pre-prepared]

...

- The organisation that amasses in total is cleared

...

- The organisation begins afresh, like folding over a page except without limitation as the produced structure is squirreled away to some storage space
  - a) removing pressure on memory
  - b) removing pressure on RAM
  - c) becoming available _in crystallo_ at a later date
  - d) not just blindly preserved but alongside other items, which can to a degree be assumed associated to the train of thought [else pruned]
