- Background: [[Memory:latency isomorphism]], regarding the tragedy of the commons (?) of new information intake without associated and _elegant/sufficient_ processing
  - I can sense a relation in this isomorphism to the power structure/requirements in question/under creation/in generation/under construction...
    - for information on a computer for example the RAM/swap connection is a component of power stability of information
      - **like proteins this is a metastable state**
