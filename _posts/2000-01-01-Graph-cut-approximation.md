Fascinated that a 2015 computer vision patent on biomed image analysis ([_Denoising medical images_](https://www.google.com/patents/US20110268328)) (graph cut approx) came from a 1969 electrical model of flow networks.

- 2015 patent: [approximating graph cut by solving a set of simultaneous non-linear equations based on analog electrical model of flow network](https://www.google.com/patents/US8929636)
  - I. T. Frisch, Proc. IEEE, 1969, [_On electrical analogs for flow networks_](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1448847&tag=1)  

    > "A combinatoric argument is used to derive a diode-source analog for minimum cost flow problems."
