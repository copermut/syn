- If an RSS feed 'consumes' a post before it is finished (in draft) then it can be fed something, then the original deleted
- This represents a storage medium
  - This represents a channel
- If an RSS feed can be fed to represent a state in time this represents a temporal channel
  - If the same item can be represented in different feeds it can be a channel of multiple states in time
  - i.e. a feed can be read at multiple points in time, passed to 'mirror' feeds which end up differing slightly
- If multiple RSS feeds 'consume' a post it is stored.. in permutations?

- Essentially RSS readers are a big data maw that don't check for reversioning/edition - not sure about deletion

## Extension

- Perhaps, could be used for a form of computation wherein change of state does not impart any information — i.e., the feed is not being monitored for revision — but [think: extremely simple signalling model] only the switch between __order__ of items is indicative

  - NB tweet sent a while after being typed out 
  - just hit send, though written just after the idea arose
    - tweet time difference ~2hrs
      - 1:32pm to 3:45pm maximum difference: may have seen original tweet a short while after being sent...
      - perhaps more like 1hr, 1hr30m diff?

- (...vague sense that above calculation is relevant to that which it discusses)
  - i.e. temporal signalling in which state is not changed but delay imposed
  - __vague guess:__
    - ergodicity: invariance in dynamical system
      - message invariant (i.e. tweet pre-composed, in this case because just happened not to send)
        - other messages may be pre-composed in the sense of pre-specified
        - systems like _Buffer_ (app) permit pre-specification of e.g. marketing campaigns, or some academics [erroneously imo] believe it's better to wait to send papers etc. at 'suitable time' [essentially impose delay on readers]
          - ...imagine if histone modifiers were to act in kind...
            - [flippant example, undoubtedly they may well do]
          - relevance of analogy: a system which __foregoes agency__ in the process of construction
            - in place of agency there is: ...
            - (...incompletion, i.e. channelling
            - (that is to say temporal control above the granularity of user-user interaction
            - {note on notation: Hales's notes on _Vegetable Staticks' section on Newton's [notes on air](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIrG5C5Dy-H/?taken-by=lmmddx) gave quotation marks in left hand margin only,  
              {which appeared odd however in fact clarifies continuation of clausal relations

- [cont.]: (NB elided list levels here, also NB invisible HTML comment precedes this line)
    - dynamical state: oscillations are created in miRNA-imposed decay inducing delay in a system of gene regulation

- __NB__: more hypothetical/theoretical than the identitarian focus of the tweet being responded to
  - more signal processing / information theoretical notion but obviously application domain is open
