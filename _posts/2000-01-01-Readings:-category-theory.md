  > ## Why Not Try Category Theory?

  > Since the death of Grothendieck I have seen a growing number of references to the area of [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) from a variety of different fronts.

  > Most notably, for the past year I’ve been more closely following John Baez’s [Azimuth Blog](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/05/23/category-theory-for-scientists/) which has frequent [posts relating to category theory](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/?s=category+theory) with applications I can directly use in various areas. Unfortunately I couldn’t attend his recent workshop at NIMBioS on [Information and Entropy in Biological Systems](http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS_entropy), which apparently means I missed meeting Tom Leinster who recently released the textbook _[Basic Category Theory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107044243/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1107044243&linkCode=as2&tag=boffosocko-20&linkId=X357HLMWCOR3NDYX)_ (Cambridge University Press, 2014). [I was already never going to forgive myself after I missed the workshop, but this fact now seems to be additional salt in the wound.]

  > The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back was my serendipitously stumbling across [Ilyas Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ilyas-khan/53/994/2a8)‘s excellent post “[Category Theory – the bedrock of mathematics?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/category-theory-bedrock-mathematics-ilyas-khan)” while doing a Google image search for something entirely unrelated to anything remotely similar to mathematics. His discussion and the breadth of links to interesting and intriguing papers and articles within it and several colleagues thanking me for posting about it have finally forced my hand. (I also find myself wishing that he would write on a more formal basis more frequently.)

  > So over the past week or so, I’ve done some basic subject area searching, and I’ve picked up David I. Spivak’s book _[Category Theory for the Sciences](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262028131/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262028131&linkCode=as2&tag=boffosocko-20&linkId=MZISLDJYWDPTNSZQ)_ (The MIT Press, 2014) to begin [plowing](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1275059630) through it.
