A trinity I'm using (as in a design/architectural _pattern_):

### Lever: [carets](https://github.com/lmmx/carets)
- after Isaac Asimov, _Skewered!_ (1974)

### Aphorism: [metaphorism](https://github.com/lmmx/metaphorism)
- Originated in looking for puns on 'metaphor', producing another - 'metaphorest' - which has a more functional meaning when extrapolated to the [real, statistical] concept of 'random forest'
  - _Everyone_ at the algorithms conference I attended recently was really into puns, it did not go unnoticed...

### Analogy: [NAlogical](https://github.com/lmmx/NAlogical)
- As a channel, addressed [vocative], appears as "@nalogical", a proverb in itself on how semantics may appear only in communication.

- - -

#### Trinities:

Both applicable [in the same order] to the above:

- [M-V-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller): Model–View–Controller
- Pascal's 3 orders: of flesh [sense], mind [reason], and hand [charity] (MVC again)
  - via [_The Epistemology of Pascal's Wager_](http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/joe_esala/pt.joe_esala.wager.html)

  ... A "_leitmotif_" to his defence from defensive atheists:

- as surmised already without the historical certainty, order has a numerical sense. Who's to say _copermutation_ did not have such a significance to him too. The point here is on a linguistic 'state space'
