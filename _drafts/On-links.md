- It feels dissonant calling things "saved links" when they're saved without any contextual information to represent an edge
  - if all that's "stored" is a link, not only may it change, it's in a sense almost inevitable that it will (no man is an island, nor are web pages or their content)

- Twitter seems particularly egregious: decidedly linear, encourages thinking as such
  - i.e. : if you can only share individual pages, and can only therefore visit individual pages, you come to think the web exists as such

- ...trying to use these web services as fully functional repositories for thought (such as to store a train of thought to switch to another without losing detail in the process) highlights exactly the opposite to be the case.

Thought proceeds through [[attentional verticals]] (or choose your own metaphor) wherein many possible-links ("maybe-clicked", "maybe-passed over" but no less a part of the space as such) interweave with social connections, as well as other transient (growing, temporary, unstable etc.) elements.

- "time travel" back through search space to past events - such as Facebook _social graph_ search highlight this temporal facet of web existence and thought
  - for example, searching for _[khronos vulkan](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=khronos%20vulkan)_ brings up the thread of its history to date (history and evolution).
  - It's not possible to represent this in a "link" in a way that will persist: Facebook search on the same link in a few months time will be reordered for example. This is not the only example but it is indicative of the points made above.

The point of the above is to question what would it mean to "link" to a thread of thought (as above, to condense a dozen or so pieces on the history of a successor to _OpenGL_ would be)

- computer vision may be the key
  - can web browsers do CV?
  - "minds locked together"

  - ...browser-eye burn: latency of always waiting for pages to load leaves the screen whited out and must surely hurt your eyes in the long term as noted with the likes of _[f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)_, the optical concept of _bloom_ would [_lever_](https://github.com/lmmx/carets)age this (under 'computer vision' metaphor, _bloom_ can be seen through both information theoretic and optical concept)
  - pulling in pages through microindexing of nodes and their connections would allow elevator-shaft like _[[verticals]]_ descending through a __set__ of items without latency, without wasting life in the 'lift between floors', wasting your retinas. But noone says anything because it seems like we have "links". We don't, we have tabulations at best.
  - this idea doesn't just refer to data structure though, but thought structure (i.e. one's conception of potentiality of thought)
    - _structured_ relations provide set _ontology_
      - once visualised as such, control structures can be seen, not just "links": anticipation of feedback loops, temporal structures etc (flow, history, and evolution; motifs, patterns, the very means of biological development and organisation)
      - this cannot be shared in the same way an entry point to a system of thought: what is shared is an object/domain of thought. _Properly_ befitting the title of a "link"
- previous experience in developing a browser automation extension may assist (but accessing page content has been made deliberately awkward)
  - [[computer vision]] wouldn't need permission... you don't need permission to look at a screen if called on to do so.
