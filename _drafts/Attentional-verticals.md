Background: initial ideas on [[permutation graphs and copermutations]]

### Developments:

- General 'breadth-first', 'depth-first' heuristics as directions in learning/idea exploration

- Recent development to Google TensorFlow API that has been very clarifying as to this dialectic:

  - "[ML models with both memorization and generalization with __Wide and Deep Learning__ in TensorFlow](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html)"

  > #### The Progress of Insight is Non-Linear  
  
  > Whenever we approach unknown territory (in this case complex things like technical software), we typically start by making some first cautious steps, testing something here and there, trying to make sense of what we see and experience. 

  > Depending on our unique personalities, we might continue with trial and error, or eventually consult the manual. I think it’s safe to say that most people read documentation sooner or later and jump between how-tos, practical tips, reference documentation and FAQs. 

  > The progress of insight from exploring new things, either by trial and error or reading the docs, is not foreseeable at all. It’s true that __the learning curve of humans approaching new areas is more or less steep__, but what’s more important is that it’s completely non-linear, at least for most of us.

  > Documentation should just be there to support people when they got stuck, or to lift them onto the next level of wisdom. In contrast, classical technical documentation is linear and oftentimes structured like a print document: A sequence of chapters and sections with a leading index.

  > If there’s any structure beyond that, it is merely a tree: Chapters and sub-chapters. That’s it. This might be good for storytelling, but surely not optimal for supporting a non-linear learning path.

  - _"more or less steep"_: [[vertical|verticals]]
  - _non-linear_: subjective, attention/imagination-directed path on knowledge graph

## Directions from computer vision

- Wiki: [guided search model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_search#Guided_search_model) puts across 'bottom up' approach to search space well
- to develop: (iso?)[[morphism representation|Search in category theory]] of this problem statement  <sup>`TODO:develop`</sup>

## Notes

- It strikes me that search is always presented as a 'top-down' problem of inference, that is (despite best efforts to show Google etc. as user-serving processes rather than a corporate interest) the models of intention are not so much presented for the user's utility (autofill recommendation, search result reordering per user/inferred cohort) as to lead along a desired attentional path (inform[ation]ally direct user fate)
- Thought proceeds through prospective lines of enquiry, with subsequently, often, only a niche few being explored due to attentional/time constraints.
- To consider attention as a market, and to borrow a spatial metaphor from investment/business management jargon, "[[verticals]]" (short for 'vertical markets'), a niche line of enquiry in an attention market can be termed an 'attentional vertical'. In this lingo, a horizontal market indicates a broad market [i.e. non-niche], so a dimension of depth would be more appropriate to indicate the extension of a vertical.
  - Personally I'm reminded of the stockroom scene in the Matrix, which illustrates this quite nicely, with the products of attention being [within] the filing cabinets - an apt visual metaphor for discussions of document/literature search.

  - Incidentally: long after _The Matrix_ came out, the stockroom scene was parodied by one of the _MoneySupermarket_ / _Compare The Market_ / _MySupermarket_-genre adverts copying this scene but with virtual groceries, car insurance etc. (may make concept's application to markets easier to visualise for those who've seen these on TV)

- the concept of being 'open to nearby agents' in the definition of [[verticals]] (accompanying 'niche/specialised') can be seen in the 2017 [`<Programming>`](http://2017.programming-conference.org/home) conference's requirements for "Plain language" in technical presentations;

  > Each paper must be accompanied by a plain-language abstract that presents the key points in the paper in a manner understandable by experienced practitioners and researchers in nearby disciplines.
