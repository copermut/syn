> Language comprehension is, in part, a morphism from a nonsymmetric compact closed monoidal category to a closed cartesian category

> - as syntax is well modeled as a nonsymmetric closed monoidal category, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar#Type_theory

> - whereas lambda calculus, the core of logic, is the natural language for closed cartesian categories, http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/10/from-lambda-calculus-to-cartes/

> Following the arrows (and errors) from one to the other is an interesting exercise...

> The closed cartesian categories seem to have the symmetries needed to support probability theory, if you read http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4831 with some imagination (and as PLN supports though without full rigorous proof) ... so while this morphism loses something it does gain some useful stuff ...
